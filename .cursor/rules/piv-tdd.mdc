# TDD Requirements (MANDATORY)

**RED → GREEN → REFACTOR** - No exceptions.

## The Cycle
1. 🔴 **RED**: Write failing test FIRST - test MUST fail before any implementation
2. 🟢 **GREEN**: Write MINIMAL code to make test pass - no more, no less
3. 🔵 **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green

## Rules
- ❌ NEVER write implementation code before the test
- ❌ NEVER skip TDD for "simple" code
- ✅ Test must fail with clear assertion error
- ✅ One logical assertion per test

## Test Structure (Given-When-Then)
```
GIVEN: Setup test data and preconditions
WHEN:  Execute the code being tested
THEN:  Verify expected outcomes
```
