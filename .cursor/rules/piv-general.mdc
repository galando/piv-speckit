# PIV Development Rules

Follow these rules for all code in this project.

## Core Principles
- **Understand first**: Read existing code before modifying
- **Match patterns**: Follow existing codebase conventions
- **Minimal changes**: Only change what's necessary
- **Self-documenting**: Clear names over comments

## DRY & KISS
- Check for existing implementations before creating new
- Prefer simple over clever solutions
- Single source of truth for each piece of knowledge
