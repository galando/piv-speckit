## Deferred Items

The following items from the plan were intentionally deferred:

### Phase 3: GitHub Discussions
- **Reason**: Requires manual setup via GitHub web UI
- **Action Item**: Repository owner must enable Discussions and create categories
- **Categories to Create**: Show & Tell, Questions, Ideas, PIV Experiences

### Phase 4: Demo GIF
- **Reason**: Requires screen recording and editing
- **Action Item**: Follow guidelines in `assets/README.md` to create
- **Target**: 15-30 second GIF showing complete PIV cycle

### Phase 4: Video Tutorials
- **Reason**: Time-intensive to create properly
- **Action Item**: Planned for v1.1.0 release
- **Videos Needed**: 3-5 quick start videos

### Phase 4: Logo/Branding
- **Reason**: Design work required
- **Action Item**: Optional, can use text badges for now
- **Assets Needed**: logo.png, og-image.png
