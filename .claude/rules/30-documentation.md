# Documentation Rules

## Core Principles

- **Document as You Code** - Update docs when code changes
- **Document the Why, Not the What** - Code shows what
- **Keep Docs Current** - Outdated docs are worse than none
- **Write for Future You** - You'll forget context

## When to Document

✅ **Document:**
- Complex algorithms (explain why)
- Non-obvious decisions (trade-offs)
- API contracts (inputs, outputs, side effects)
- Configuration (options, environment variables)

❌ **Don't Document:**
- Obvious code
- Implementation details that change frequently
- Information that's already in code (types, names)

## Code Comments

**Good Use:**
- Explaining why (not what)
- Documenting workarounds
- Non-obvious behavior

**Bad Use:**
- Obvious comments (`// increment i`)
- Restating code
- Outdated information

## README Structure

- Project name + brief description
- Features list
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Tech stack
- How to contribute
