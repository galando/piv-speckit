# Pragmatic Programmer Principles

**From:** *The Pragmatic Programmer* by Hunt & Thomas

Apply these principles to EVERY feature and code change:

## ✅ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Single authoritative source for each piece of knowledge
- Check codebase for existing implementations before creating new
- Reuse patterns, don't duplicate logic

## ✅ Broken Windows (Fix Broken Windows)

- Fix technical debt when you see it
- Don't create new broken windows
- Small fixes prevent big problems

## ✅ Automate

- If it's not automated, it's a problem
- Tests, scripts, CI/CD for everything
- Avoid manual processes

## ✅ Design for Change

- Code will change - design for it
- Modular, flexible, loosely coupled
- Balance flexibility with YAGNI

## ✅ Stone Soup

- Show incremental value
- Let requirements evolve
- Start small, grow

## ✅ Good-Enough Software

- Perfect is the enemy of good
- Ship working software
- Iterate based on feedback
